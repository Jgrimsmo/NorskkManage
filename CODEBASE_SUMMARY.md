# NorskkManage - Codebase Summary and Recent Improvements

## Overview

NorskkManage is a React Native cross-platform application built with Expo that provides construction management tools including time tracking, project management, crew management, equipment tracking, and safety reporting.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database)
- **Cross-Platform**: React Native Web for browser compatibility
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with file-based routing
- **UI**: Custom components with modular styling system

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Style System Modularization
- **Cleaned up redundant style files**: Removed `globalStyles-old.ts` and `globalStyles-new.ts`
- **Unified style exports**: All styles now exported from `styles/index.ts`
- **Created documentation**: Added `styles/README.md` explaining the modular system
- **Updated imports**: All components now use unified style imports

### 2. Delete Functionality Verification
- **Debugged timecard deletion**: Added comprehensive logging to trace delete operations
- **Confirmed Firebase integration**: Verified Firestore security rules allow authenticated deletes
- **Tested user authentication**: Confirmed user context is properly passed to delete functions
- **Cleaned up debug code**: Removed all test code and debug console.log statements

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- **Removed test functions**: Cleaned up temporary debugging code
- **Improved error handling**: Better error messages and user feedback
- **Consistent code formatting**: Aligned with TypeScript best practices

## Key Features

### Time Tracking (Timecards)
- **Real-time data synchronization** with Firestore
- **Advanced filtering** by date, employee, project, status
- **Export functionality** to CSV/Excel formats
- **Approval workflow** for managers
- **Delete functionality** with confirmation dialogs

### Project Management
- **Project creation and editing** with cost codes
- **Scope item management** with detailed tracking
- **Progress monitoring** and status updates
- **Integration** with time tracking and estimating

### Crew Management
- **Employee profiles** with contact information
- **Role-based permissions** and access control
- **Time tracking integration** for labor costs

### Equipment Management
- **Equipment inventory** tracking
- **Usage logging** and maintenance scheduling
- **Cost allocation** to projects

### Safety Features
- **Daily safety reports** with photo attachments
- **FLHA (Field Level Hazard Assessment)** forms
- **Incident reporting** and tracking

## Firebase Integration

### Authentication
- **Email/password authentication** via Firebase Auth
- **User context** managed through React Context API
- **Protected routes** requiring authentication

### Data Storage
- **Firestore collections**:
  - `timeEntries` - Time tracking records
  - `projects` - Project information and cost codes
  - `crew` - Employee/crew member data
  - `equipment` - Equipment inventory
  - `dailyReports` - Safety reports
  - `flhaForms` - Hazard assessment forms

### Security Rules
- **Authentication required** for all operations
- **User-based access control** for sensitive data
- **Proper read/write permissions** configured

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript** for all new components
- **Functional components** with React Hooks
- **Modular styles** using the unified style system
- **Error boundaries** and proper error handling

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual testing** on both mobile and web platforms
- **Firebase emulator** for development testing
- **Real-time data validation** during development

### Performance Considerations
- **Real-time listeners** for live data updates
- **Optimized rendering** with proper key props
- **Lazy loading** for large datasets
- **Image optimization** for photos and attachments

## Known Issues Resolved

1. ✅ **Delete button functionality** - Verified working across all pages
2. ✅ **Style system confusion** - Unified into single export
3. ✅ **Firebase authentication** - Confirmed working properly
4. ✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** - Web and mobile tested

## Future Improvements

### Suggested Enhancements
- **Unit testing** with Jest and React Native Testing Library
- **Offline support** with Firebase offline persistence
- **Push notifications** for important updates
- **Advanced reporting** with charts and analytics
- **Mobile app optimization** for better performance

### Code Refactoring Opportunities
- **Component optimization** for better reusability
- **State management** improvements with Redux or Zustand
- **API layer abstraction** for better service organization
- **Type safety improvements** with stricter TypeScript config

## Deployment

### Development
- **Expo Development Server**: `npm start`
- **Web Preview**: Accessible via Expo DevTools
- **Mobile Testing**: Expo Go app or development builds

### Production
- **Web Deployment**: Compatible with standard web hosting
- **Mobile Distribution**: App Store and Google Play via Expo Application Services
- **Firebase Hosting**: Configured for web deployment
