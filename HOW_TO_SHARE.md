## 🔗 **Option 1: Share GitHub Repository (RECOMMENDED)**

### **Repository URL:**
```
https://github.com/Jgrimsmo/NorskkManage
```

### **How to Share:**
1. **Make repository public** (if it's private):
   - Go to GitHub.com → Your repository
   - Settings → General → Danger Zone → Change visibility

2. **Or invite collaborators** (if keeping private):
   - Settings → Manage access → Invite a collaborator
   - Enter their GitHub username/email

3. **Share this message with the developer:**
   ```
   Hi! I'd like you to work on my NorskkManage React Native app.
   
   Repository: https://github.com/Jgrimsmo/NorskkManage
   
   Please follow the setup instructions in DEVELOPER_SETUP.md
   You'll need to create your own Firebase project for development.
   
   Let me know if you have any questions!
   ```

## 📦 **Option 2: Download and Share as ZIP**
