# Security Configuration Notes

## What Was Changed for Security

### 1. Environment Variables
- **Before**: Firebase config hardcoded in `/config/firebase.ts`
- **After**: Moved to environment variables in `.env` file
- **Files Modified**: 
  - Created `.env.example` (template for developers)
  - Created `.env` (your actual config - DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE)
  - Updated `/config/firebase.ts` to use environment variables

### 2. Git Ignore Updates
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data
- This ensures your API keys won't be exposed in version control

### 3. Firestore Security Rules
- **Before**: Wide-open rules allowing any authenticated user to read/write anything
- **After**: Granular permissions based on user roles and data ownership
- **Key Changes**:
  - Users can only access their own data
  - Project access limited to assigned users
  - Equipment requires admin role for modifications
  - Safety reports restricted to creators
  - Crew management requires supervisor/admin roles

### 4. Developer Documentation
- Created `DEVELOPER_SETUP.md` with complete setup instructions
- Includes security best practices
- Guides developers to create their own Firebase projects

## Important Notes for You

### Before Sharing:
1. **Remove the `.env` file** from your repository before sharing:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached .env
   git commit -m "Remove environment variables from tracking"
   ```

2. **Verify .gitignore is working**:
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should not show .env file
   ```

### For the Developer:
- They will need to create their own Firebase project
- They should copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in their own values
- The security rules are now much more restrictive and require proper user roles

### Testing the Changes:
The app should still work the same way, but now uses environment variables. If you encounter any issues, check that your `.env` file has all the correct values.

## Security Benefits Achieved:
✅ No hardcoded API keys in source code  
✅ Environment-specific configuration  
✅ Proper Firestore security rules  
✅ Clear setup documentation for developers  
✅ Sensitive data excluded from version control  

Your codebase is now much safer to share with developers!
